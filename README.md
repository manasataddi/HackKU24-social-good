# Food For All

Welcome to "Food For All" - a web platform dedicated to fostering a community of sharing and sustainability. Our mission is simple: connect restaurants with surplus food to those in need, turning potential waste into nourishing meals for the underprivileged. 

In a world where food waste and hunger coexist, "Food For All" stands as a beacon of hope. We believe that every dish deserves a place at someone's table, and through our platform, we make this possible. By partnering with local restaurants, we ensure that leftover food serves not just as a meal, but as a symbol of hope and dignity for those within our community.

Join us in our movement towards social good. Together, we can reduce food waste and feed more than just hunger â€“ we feed souls.
